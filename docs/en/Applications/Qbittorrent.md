#Qbittorrent

## Qbittorrent settings

By default you must use as username (admin/adminadmin)

### File saving path

data source: /home/USER/local/qbittorrent/downloads/â€¦

!! ATTENTION !!
If you use a specific path (for example /home/user/local/qbittorrent), you should remember to modify the configuration of cloudplow/crop so that the folder is not taken into account for uploads

> From the interface, you must use the full path `/home/USER/local/qbittorrent/downloads/...`  

We will start by securing and putting the interface in French

#### Language (Tools/Option/web interface)

Here we can change the default username and password and also disable auth with localhost

### Added Qbittorrent to Radarr and Sonarr (Download client - Remote Path Mappings)

> Be careful you have to adapt the path according to your settings, personally I use the categories to move the content to a specific folder at the end, also I prefer to indicate the complete path but it also works with `/home/$USER/local`
