# Step by step installation

## we begin !!!
> You have followed the Prerequisites so we move on to installing the script which will install all the dependencies (including Docker).

### you need a NON-root user, who has sudo rights

On Debian, you have to start by installing sudo
```
apt-get update
apt install -y sudo
```

If you only have root:
```
adduser seed # change "seed" to the user you want, and answer the questions
usermod -aG sudo seed # change "seed" to the user you want
```
Once all this is done, log out of your root session, and reconnect with the user that has just been created

Afterwards

## Installing the script
### Package update:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
### Installing Git:
```
sudo apt install -y git
```
### Cloning the script:
```
sudo git clone https://github.com/projetssd/ssdv2.git /home/${USER}/seedbox-compose
```
### Change of rights
```
sudo chown -R ${USER}: /home/${USER}/seedbox-compose
```
To run the script:
```
cd /home/${USER}/seedbox-compose && ./seedbox.sh
```

### You will get this message:
```
IMPORTANT !
==================================================== =
Your user was not in the docker group
It has been added, but you must disconnect/reconnect for the rest of the process to work
```
So disconnect then reconnect and continue with the same command
```
cd /home/${USER}/seedbox-compose && ./seedbox.sh
```
