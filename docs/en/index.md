First of all, a big thank you to TRaSH-Guides and their work which I used to create the radarr/sonarr sections and offer a French translation.
https://trash-guides.info/

Radarr/Sonarr deserved to have in-depth documentation knowing that their configurations often raise questions and are not necessarily obvious to a beginner.

The SSD script has been reworked since the end of the clouds and is now oriented around RealDebrid. It offers the possibility of installing around a hundred applications outside of the standards such as plex, radarr, sonarr, rdtclient, overseerr etc.

### In detail
